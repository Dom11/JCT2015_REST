### What is this repository for? ###

To test rest services directly from the browser
----------------------------------------------
http://localhost:8080/RestService/rest/profiles/list

* This repository should provide an inside perspective of the current development status
* Version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Eclipse Luna, JDK 8 (version 8u25),
* Maven: not yet set up as maven project (there seem to be missing parameters in my current set-up)
* DB MySQL (not yet integrated, details will follow)
* UI: see repository JCT2015_UI

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Let's have look at my maven configuration to convert it as a maven project
* RestAPI currently cannot be deployed to Server, there must be some kind of error but I can't figure out what's wrong with it. This RestAPI is a 99% clone of Rob's version. 

### Who do I talk to? ###

* assigned Project Group
